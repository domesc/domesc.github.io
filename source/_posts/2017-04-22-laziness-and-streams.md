In the real world laziness is the feeling, some people have, of doing the least work or effort possible. In functional programming ... well if we think about it, it's kind of the same concept.
Indeed, laziness consists in avoiding any computation that is not needed straight away, but deferring them to a later stage.

One can easily ask why should I make my life difficult? It turns out that sometimes applying this concept to your program can be quite useful.
In the following paragraphs I will try to go step by step from the basis to some applications of laziness like Streams. Every example in this post and probably in every future post will be written in Scala, a functional programming language running on the JVM, which I use in my current job and which I find simply awesome.

So let's start!  
<br/>

Deferred evaluation and lazy keyword
------------------------------------

In Scala there are two ways of passing parameters to a function, one is by value the other by name. Let's see the difference through some examples:

{% gist domesc/e8aee98f315d406d5d88114d6b54514b %}

When we call `callByValue` and `callByName` functions we see two different results in the REPL,
despite the fact that the body of both does exactly the same thing:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> callByValue(square(2))
The square is 4.0
Square by value is  4.0
Square by value is 4.0

scala> callByName(square(2))
The square is 4.0
Square by name is 1 4.0
The square is 4.0
Square by name is 2 4.0
{% endhighlight %}

First of all I have to precise that one of the reason why this code is producing different results is because of the `println` calls, which create side-effects killing the purity of the function. Closing the parenthesis the other reason is that in `callByValue` the `square` function is evaluated before everything and the evaluated parameter is passed to the body of the function. On the other hand in `callByName` the evaluation is deferred to the point when the parameter is used and every time re-evaluated.

This is exactly what we wanted to do, right? Defer the evaluation and make it happen later, that's the definition of laziness!

Wait ... that's awesome, but why re-evaluating every time the parameter? In case we are passing a function by name, which takes up a lot of time to evaluate we will repeat the computation twice eating up CPU.

Let's see how we can modify `callByName` to avoid the aforementioned problem:

{% gist domesc/8ddf86261fcc08311031d1fc233348e4 %}

What I did here was to assign the parameter reference to a `lazy val`. Let's call the modified function now and see:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> callByName(square(2))
The square is 4.0
Square by name is 4.0
Square by name is 4.0
{% endhighlight %}

Clearly this time the evaluation of `square(2)` happened only once and that's because of the `lazy val` construct. The computation is still deferred, but the first time the evaluation was required the result was cached, so that the computed value could be reused and no further evaluation is needed.

The `lazy` keyword is a great tool, but it has to be used with some care. The issues that you can incur are described in [SIP-20](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/improved-lazy-val-initialization.html).

Now that laziness concept is hopefully clear and we saw how this is handled in Scala, next step is to see another powerful tool which is built upon laziness: the Streams.

Streams
-------

Probably every developer had to deal in his career with some sort of collection like lists or arrays. We build a collection of elements, which take space in memory and once the allocation is done we can start making operations on it like iterating, adding an element etc. But what if we don't want to load all the elements in memory from the beginning? What if we want to store only the type of computations we want to make on the collection without actually applying them straight away?
That is actually what a `Stream` does.

A `Stream` can be thought as a lazy `List` where the head is evaluated while the tail is not. That can be easily seen in the following code snippet:

{% gist domesc/c92c21206ca38175cc3157abaf70def1 %}

The above code has been extracted from Scala 2.12 repository, it is probably the simplest way to show how the `Stream` constructor take the `head` by value and the `tail` by name. Let's prove everything in the REPL:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
list: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that when we create a List every element is loaded and stored into the collection.
Letâ€™s see what happens if we create a Stream of elements:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> val stream = Stream(1, 2 , 3, 4, 5)
stream: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)
{% endhighlight %}

We have now a question mark instead of the list of elements we passed to the constructor. This proves the evaluation of the tail is deferred. Next let's try to access the element at the third index which wad not evaluated:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> stream(2)
res15: Int = 3

scala> stream
res16: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, 2, 3, ?)
{% endhighlight %}

Did you notice anything? When I accessed the 3rd element Scala evaluated all the elements until the third index included.
That's awesome, we have a lazy list and we can make any kind of operation supported on normal lists like map, filter etc. but in a lazy way:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> val doubled = s.map(e => e * 2)
doubled: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(2, ?)

scala> doubled(2)
res18: Int = 6
{% endhighlight %}

And we can do even more and create an infinite `Stream`.
<br/>

Infinite Streams
----------------

The way Scala allows the creation of an infinite `Stream` is quite straight-forward:

{% highlight scala %}
scala> val infiniteStream = Stream.from(1, 1)
infiniteStream: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)
{% endhighlight %}

The code above does nothing but creating a `Stream` of integers starting from 1 and increasing by 1. To better
understand how this is built let's look at the code !

Here I paste the implementation of `from` method in the `Stream` class Scala version 2.12:

{% gist domesc/fca6365fb4730627e6793749f0ac8cf6 %}

This snippet calls the constructor I showed you before passing the initial value as head of the `Stream` and the function itself as tail

To summarize everything said until now, a `Stream` has three main functional properties:

* *lazy*: as we explained and as we can see from the `Stream` constructor, the tail of the collection is passed by name (so the evaluation is deferred).
* *recursive*: the infinite `Stream` is defined in terms of itself.
* *infinite*: which is possible thanks to the lazy property.

To conclude we saw how laziness and streams work in Scala, this doesn't include all the possible
uses and APIs examples, though it gives you an idea on how things works. For more information
on the `Stream` APIs this is the link to the [Scala Doc](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.10.2/#scala.collection.immutable.Stream).
